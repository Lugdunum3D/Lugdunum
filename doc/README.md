# Documentation

Here lies the documentation of Lugdunum's 3D engine.

It is written in markdown with a few additional syntaxes, as it will be used by https://github.com/Lugdunum3D/Lugdunum-Tools/tree/master/generate-doc to generate the appropriate markdown for the [website](https://lugdunum3d.github.io/doc/) and the PDF versions, generated in LaTeX.

It is the right place to edit the documentation to have the changes mirrored to the website.

# Additonal Syntax

See [here](https://github.com/Lugdunum3D/Lugdunum-Tools/tree/master/generate-doc/README.md) for the syntax used here.
